 1. Approach to Designing Software

- How do I approach designing software?
  - I approach software design by first understanding the problem space and the requirements. I then create a high-level architecture, focusing on modularity and scalability. The design process is iterative, allowing for refinement as I gather more insights or face challenges.

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  - Working on this project helped me develop skills in designing 3D scenes using computational graphics, applying principles of lighting, texture mapping, and camera positioning. It also honed my ability to create detailed documentation, which is essential for collaborative development.

- What design process did you follow for your project work?
  - My design process involved several stages: 
    1. Requirement Analysis: Understanding what the 3D scene needed to convey.
    2. Conceptual Design: Sketching out initial ideas and determining which shapes and textures would best achieve the desired effect.
    3. Implementation: Developing the scene in code, adjusting elements like lighting and camera angles.
    4. Testing and Refinement: Iterating on the design based on how the scene looked and felt, making adjustments to improve the overall quality.

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  - The iterative nature of my design approach, combined with a strong emphasis on testing and refinement, is a tactic I can apply to any future software projects. The attention to detail in documenting design decisions is also a practice I plan to continue, as it aids in maintaining clarity and communication within a development team.

 2. Approach to Developing Programs

- How do I approach developing programs?
  - I approach program development by breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable tasks. I prioritize understanding the core functionality first and then build out features incrementally. Testing is integrated throughout the development process to catch issues early.

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  - In developing the 3D scene, I employed strategies such as modular coding to separate different aspects of the scene (e.g., lighting, textures, shapes). I also used version control more rigorously to track changes and experiment with different design approaches without risking the stability of the project.

- How did iteration factor into your development?
  - Iteration was crucial in refining the visual aspects of the 3D scene. I would frequently test how the scene looked after each change, adjusting parameters like light intensity or texture mapping to achieve the best possible result. This iterative approach allowed for continuous improvement and helped in discovering more effective solutions.

- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  - Throughout the project, my approach evolved to become more structured and disciplined. I started by focusing on getting basic functionalities right but gradually shifted to fine-tuning details like performance optimization and code readability. My coding practices became more aligned with industry standards as I learned the importance of clean, maintainable code.

 3. Role of Computer Science in Reaching Goals

- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  - Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills and technical knowledge that are essential for pursuing a career in software development. It also provides a foundation in logic, algorithms, and system design, all of which are crucial for creating efficient and scalable applications.

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  - Computational graphics have enhanced my understanding of visual perception, geometry, and mathematical modeling. These skills are transferrable to other areas of study, such as data visualization or simulation, where visual representation of complex data is critical.

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  - In a professional context, the ability to create realistic 3D models and visualizations can be highly valuable in fields such as game development, virtual reality, and simulations. These skills also improve my capability to develop user interfaces and experiences that are both intuitive and visually appealing.
